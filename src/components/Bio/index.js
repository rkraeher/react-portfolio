                        <p> I am a Visual Media Scholar turned Full Stack Developer. While writing a doctoral dissertation on experimental
                        American aesthetics I completed a web development certificate at the University of California, Riverside.
                        Iâ€™m a creative problem solver, rabid mat&eacute; drinker, and undeterred bug sleuth.

                            My dissertation project, "Smoke and Mirrors: Queer of Color Aesthetics from the Harlem Renaissance
                            to the Present" intervenes in discourses of aesthetic form and embodied difference.

                            I enjoy building things that people find helpful and interesting. I grew up in a family
                            that built small businesses from scratch, so I can appreciate the entrepreneurial spirit
                            and the importance of self-motivation, especially in approaching complex, long-term projects.
